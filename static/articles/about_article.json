It is one of the five family systems passed down from the teachings of the Siu Lum Monk, Gee Shim, who taught five disciples surnamed Hung, Choy, Lay, Lau, and Mok. Hung- Ga, named after Hung Hei Guen, is a powerful style which encompasses the hard, long range offense of the Fu Ying (tiger form) and the soft, short range fluid defense of the Hok Ying (crane form), the evasiveness of the Lung (dragon), the precision of the Sae (snake), the swiftness of the Pao, (leopard) and the application of the Ng Hang Kuen (five element fist)."
